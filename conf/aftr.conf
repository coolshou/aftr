## section 1: required parameters
## NOTE: aftr will not start without all of these set

# address endpoint <IPv6_address>
# <IPv6_address> is the AFTR endpoint address of the Softwire tunnels.
# If the DHCPv6 ds-lite option is used, this address must match the
# advertised address.
address endpoint 2001::1

# address icmp <IPv4_address>
# <IPv4_address> is a global IPv4 address used as the source for ICMP errors
# sent back to the Internet (i.e., the ICMPv4 errors will look like returned
# from an intermediate router that has this address).
address icmp 198.18.200.10

# pool <IPv4_address> [tcp|udp|echo <min>-<max>]
# This specifies a global IPv4 address that will be used as the source
# address of NAT'ed packets sent to the Internet.  Multiple global
# addresses can be specified, at least one is required.
#
# The optional part limits the port (or id) range used for the protocol
# with the global IPv4 address in dynamical bindings (i.e., not static or
# A+P bindings which can use the reserved ports outside the range).
pool 198.18.200.1
pool 198.18.200.2 tcp 32000-64000
pool 198.18.200.2 udp 32000-64000

# acl6 <IPv6_prefix>/<prefix_length>
# This adds an (accept) entry in the IPv6 ACL. Note for a regular
# IPv6 packet the ACL is checked only when no tunnel was found,
# and the default is "deny all", so at least one acl6 entry in
# the configuration file is required.

# tunnel <IPv6_remote> [<IPv4_src>]
# This specifies an IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel configuration.  <IPv6_remote> is the
# remote (ds-lite client) IPv6 address of the tunnel. Either the tunnel
# is associated with a source address in a round robin way or it is
# associated to the specified <IPv4_src>.

# <IPv6_remote>. <*_src> are the source IPv4 address and port at the tunnel
# side of the NAT, <*_new> are the source IPv4 address and port at the
# Internet side of the NAT. <IPv4_new> should be a reserved source NAT
# address, <port_new> must not be inside a dynamic port range.

# This defines a Port-Range Router/A+P null NAT entry for the client behind

# and port at the tunnel side of the NAT. They stay unchanged both ways: this

# debug set [<level>]
# Specifies the debug level.  Default is 0.  If set to non 0, verbose log
# messages will be dumped to stderr.  The higher the level is, the noiser
# the logs are.  At present, the meaningful levels are 1 (log tunnel
# creation), 3 (log packet reads and writes), and 10 (function entry
# tracing).  If the level is omitted, it is set to 1.
