                           Switched Ethernet

Description:
-----------

The Internet connection is through an ADSL line with an IPv6 /64 prefix (6rd)
and a fixed IPv4 address (so the ISP provided Home Gateway can be configured
as a router/NAT with port forwarding).
In the whole schema, the WAN side is towards the Internet, the LAN side is
the other direction. Note this is relative to a box, i.e., a B4 WAN side
is connected to the AFTR LAN side.

Testbed boxes:
-------------

The AFTR is a Lenovo netbook running Linux RedHat (RHEL 5) with a 2.6.18
kernel (patched because of the IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel bug). It provides:
 - AFTR service (cf. aftr.conf and aftr-script files)
 - DHCPv6 service (cf. aftr-dhcpd6.conf file)
 - DNS recursive/caching service (cf. aftr-named.conf file)
It has two Ethernet interfaces (builtin + Express Card) named eth0 and eth1
(the hardware addresses are in the ifcfg-eth* files so the names are
stable between reboots, on some other Linux distribs this is performed
by a "persistent" net rule in /etc/udev/rules.d). The eth1/LAN/Express
Card board is a gigabit Ethernet which should support larger MTUs.

The internal switched Ethernet between the AFTR and B4 boxes is done
with a 5 port gigabit Ethernet switch. The MTU is 1500 but most
gigabit Ethernet NICs support more, here the limit is in the B4 boxes.

The 3 B4 boxes are Linksys WRT54GL 1.1 (one from Comcast with the AFTR
and client, the second from Fry's) and Netgear WNDR3700 (from Juniper).
Linksys run the Comcast dslite and Netgear the xalient ipv6tunnel GUIs
so only the DHCPv6 client config (b4-dhclient.conf file) is provided.
They support:
 - IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel with the AFTR box
 - dynamic (via DHCPv6) or static (Web interface) config
 - DHCPv4 server for the LAN side
 - DNS relay (done with the DHCPv4 service by dnsmasq)
 - IPv6 routing for the LAN side (useless because the ISP provides only
  an IPv6 /64 prefix and the alternate ISP (not on the figure) no IPv6
  nor a fixed IPv4 address...)
(current dnsmasq default config limits the EDNS.0 packet size to 1280,
look at the B4 software notes to change it to 4096 or wait for the next
release).

The client is an ACER AspireOne netbook running Ubuntu and Windows XP.
The only testbed specific software is (for both systems) a SSH client.
It can be connected to any of the B4 boxes or to the Home Gateway in
a transparent way (DHCPv4 client).

Addresses:
---------

The Home Gateway provides addresses in 192.168.0.0/24, 192.168.0.111 is
out of its DHCPv4 server range: no possible collision at the expense
of a proxy ARP entry. The real (i.e., provided by the HG) AFTR eth0
address is 192.168.0.17 (this address is wired in the named.conf file,
please fix it).
The AFTR/B4 switched Ethernet has no IPv4 addresses. Tunnels over it
are numbered 192.0.0.1 (AFTR) and 192.0.0.2 (B4) in the "unpublished"
draft prefix.
B4 LANs are managed by dnsmasq, B4 boxes get 192.168.1.1 and the client
an address in the 192.168.1.20-40 range (this address doesn't matter
at the exception of port forwarding).

The real public address can be shared (cf. aftr-shareone.conf and
aftr-shareone-script). In any case iptables and ip6tables must be
flushed before launching the AFTR daemon or DHCPv6 server.

The Home Gateway announces a 6rd /64 IPv6 prefix. The AFTR eth0 is
autoconfigured by received Router Advertisement but this prefix cannot
be subnetted (too small and no routing).
The AFTR/B4 switched Ethernet gets the 2001:240:63f:ff00::/64 prefix
(in a JPNIC /48 prefix allocated to Comcast for a demo?). The AFTR tunnel
end-point address is 2001:240:63f:ff01::1 (note: it must not be in the
same prefix).
B4 LANs get /64 prefixes but as explained before they can't be routed.
