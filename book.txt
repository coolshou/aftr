Chapter 1. INTRODUCTION

   ISC AFTR implements a Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite) Address Family
   Transition Router (AFTR), as described in
   draft-ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite-06.txt. This technology allows
   end-users with IPv4-only hosts or IPv4-only applications to communicate
   with IPv4 peers over an IPv6-only network.

   A DS-Lite deployment includes at least one AFTR in the ISP's network
   core, and one Basic Bridging BroadBand element (B4) at each customer
   premises.

1.1. Work in Progress

   DS-Lite is in the process of being standardized by the Softwire working
   group of the IETF. ISC AFTR actively tracks the current specification,
   but users should be aware that there may be changes to the
   specification before it is finalized as an RFC. As such, this should be
   considered a work in progress, for testing and experimentation only.

Chapter 2. GETTING STARTED

   This section provides a "quick start" to using ISC AFTR in the simplest
   configuration. For full build and configuration details, see chapter 3.

2.1. Setting Up AFTR

2.1.1. System Requirements for AFTR

     * OS: Linux or FreeBSD. Kernel must be built with IPv6 and tun(4).
       Linux kernel version must be greater than 2.6.26, to correct a
       small-packet-drop problem in tunnel46_rcv().
     * CPU: No special requirement. Note that performance is bound to the
       kernel/user context switch latency, so processor speed is the
       single biggest determiner of performance.
     * Memory: No special requirement.

2.1.2. Building AFTR

   Unpack the distribution.

   tar zxvpf aftr-1.1.tar.gz

   This creates a a directory named aftr-1.1, which we refer to as
   $src_path hereafter.

   cd $src_path
   ./configure
   make

   This creates an executable file aftr, which is the AFTR daemon program.
   It is expected to be run in the same directory as the configuration
   file aftr.conf and the script file aftr-script (there is no make
   install step).

2.1.3. Minimal AFTR Configuration

   An example aftr.conf file is located in the conf directory.

   The only required parameters are those in section 1 of the config file,
   and are briefly described here. The full set of configuration commands
   is described in section 3.3.

   address endpoint 2001::1

   This is the IPv6 address of the AFTR. Specifically, it is the endpoint
   of the IPv6 tunnel between the B4 and the AFTR.

   This address is associated with the tunnel interface, but is not
   explicitly assigned to it; instead, the aftr-start() portion of the
   script file creates a covering route to the tunnel interface.

   address icmp 192.0.0.1

   This is a global IPv4 address used as the source for ICMP errors sent
   from the AFTR to the Internet. The actual address doesn't matter, as no
   one should try to respond to an ICMP packet.

   acl6 2001::/48

   This is an Access Control List for IPv6 traffic from the B4 to the
   AFTR. It is the IPv6 prefix that encloses the portion of the provider's
   network that is served by this AFTR. If the AFTR serves customers
   served by multiple disjoint IPv6 prefixes, there can be multiple acl6
   commands.

   pool 198.18.200.1

   This is a global IPv4 address in the service provider's network, which
   will be used as the NATted address for packets sent to the Internet.

   Multiple pool addresses may be defined, and restrictions may be placed
   on port ranges to use for NAT bindings.

2.1.4. AFTR Script

   The aftr executable requires a startup/shutdown script. When aftr
   starts up, it calls the script's start function to bring up the tunnel
   interface, and set up routes to the interface.

   When aftr shuts down, it calls the script's stop function to bring down
   the tunnel interface, and remove all routes to the interface.

   By default, the script file is named aftr-script, and resides in the
   same directory as the aftr executable file.

   The conf directory contains example aftr-script files for Linux and
   FreeBSD.

2.1.5. Running AFTR

   First, make sure your interfaces are configured correctly, and IPv4 and
   IPv6 forwarding are enabled. On Linux, you may also want to disable
   netfilter for performance reasons.

   Note: Linux netfilter tables need to be flushed ('iptables -F' and
   'ip6tables -F') explicitly.

   To start AFTR, run the aftr executable in the same directory as the
   aftr.conf configuration file and the aftr-script script file. For other
   startup options, see section 3.2.

   AFTR normally starts as a daemon process. To access the control
   interface, telnet to localhost port 1015. AFTR can also be started in
   foreground mode, which gives immediate access to the control interface.
   For control commands, see section 3.4.

2.2. Setting Up B4

   The B4 is the customer-side DS-Lite tunnel initiator. In the most
   common use case, it is a home gateway, also referred to as a CPE
   (Customer Premises Equipment).

   For testing and demonstration purposes, we have used home gateways
   (e.g., Linksys WRT54GL) running OpenWrt, a Linux distribution tailored
   for home gateways and related devices. B4 functionality can also be
   built into general-purpose computers, and has been demonstrated in
   FreeBSD and Ubuntu Linux. In all of these cases, the important thing to
   keep in mind is that the B4 device is the IPv4 default router for all
   hosts behind it.

2.2.1. System Requirements for B4

   There are no special requirements above what one might expect for a
   home gateway. The only added functionality that makes it a B4 is to set
   up an IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel, and to encapsulate/decapsulate all IPv4
   traffic to/from that tunnel; and all home gateways that can run OpenWrt
   can do that.

2.2.2. Building B4

   Note: More information, and prebuilt images for WRT54G devices, can be
   found at http://www.kangaroo.comcast.net

   The following instructions are for building an OpenWrt image from
   sources.
    1. Get OpenWrt sources from https://dev.openwrt.org
    2. Copy the contents of the conf/b4-openwrt directory to a new
       directory named openwrt/version/package/dhcp4
    3. Go to the openwrt/version directory, run make menuconfig, and make
       the following selections:
          + Select 2.6 kernel: Target System > Broadcom BCM947xx/953xx (or
            your target architecture)
          + Deselect busybox udhcp client: Base system > busybox >
            Configuration > Networking Utilities
          + Select dhcp4-client and dhcpv6: Network > isc-dhcp
          + Select the non-busybox version of ip: Network > ip
          + Select ip6-tunnel: Kernel modules > Network Support >
            kmod-ip6-tunnel

2.3. Other Setup

2.3.1. DHCPv6 Configuration

   draft-ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite-06.txt says:

     In order to configure the IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel, the B4 element needs
     the IPv6 address of the AFTR element. This IPv6 address can be
     configured using a variety of methods, ranging from an out-of-band
     mechanism, manual configuration or a variety of DHCPv6 options.

     In order to guarantee interoperability, a B4 element SHOULD
     implement the DHCPv6 option defined in
     [I-D.ietf-softwire-ds-lite-tunnel-option].

   The DHCP server does not have to run on the same computer as the AFTR,
   but it must be reachable via normal DHCP request channels from the B4,
   and it must be configured with the AFTR address.
     * On the server, add something like the following to dhcpd6.conf:
       option dhcp6.dslite code 54 = ip6-address;
       option dhcp6.dslite 2001::1;
       NOTE: For testing, we use an unassigned DHCPv6 option code. DO NOT
       use this option code in production, as it is likely to change when
       the draft reaches RFC status.
       The IPv6 address must be the same as the address endpoint option in
       aftr.conf.
     * On the B4, dhclient6.conf contains the following to request the
       option:
       option dhcp6.dslite code 54 = ip6-address;
       also request dhcp6.dslite;
       If you are using the supplied OpenWrt dhcp4 package, dhclient6.conf
       already contains these lines, and dhclient-script contains a few
       extra lines to set up the tunnel and create a default IPv4 route to
       it.

2.3.2. DNS Configuration

   draft-ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite-06.txt recommends configuring the
   B4 with a DNS proxy resolver, which will forward queries to an external
   recursive server over IPv6 (this server may be co-located on the AFTR
   box).

   To configure the B4 with an upstream resolver address, add something
   like the following to dhcpd6.conf:

   option dhcp6.name-servers 3ffe:501:ffff:100:200:ff:fe00:3f3e;

   Note: if the B4 uses dnsmasq as a DNS proxy, then the used version
   should be checked. Only recent versions are RFC 5625 compliant; in
   particular the EDNS0 UDP size can be limited to 1280 bytes instead of
   the recommended 4096 bytes.

   It is easy to fix this last point by configuration:

     * Add in /etc/config/dhcp in the dnsmasq section the line:
       option ednspacket_max 4096
     * If dnsmasq is launched directly, add these arguments:
       -P 4096

3.2. Command Line Options

   Included inline aftr (8)

Name

   aftr — Address Family Transition Router

Synopsis

   aftr [-g] [-t] [-c config-file] [-d device-name] [-p port-number] [-s
   script-file] [-u socket-name]

OPTIONS

   -g
          By default the aftr process becomes a daemon, -g keeps it in
          foreground with logging to stderr.

   -t
          -t can be used to check a configuration file.

   -c config-file
          The aftr daemon requires a configuration file. By default it is
          named aftr.conf, and is located in $src_path. The AFTRCONFIG
          environment variable and the -c argument give an alternate path.
          A sample configuration file is provided in
          $src_path/conf/aftr.conf (OS independent).

   -d device-name
          Linux: The aftr process opens /dev/net/tun and set the name of
          the interface to the AFTRDEVICE environment variable or the -d
          command line argument value or by default 'tun0'.

          FreeBSD: The aftr process opens /dev/tunXXX from the AFTRDEVICE
          environment variable or the -d command or by default /dev/tun0.
          The 'auto' value uses the first free /dev/tunXXX device.

          The tunnel interface/device specification can be a full path
          (/dev/...), a relative name or a number.

   -p port-number
          Use the port-number for TCP control channels. Default is 1015.

   -s script-file
          The aftr daemon executes a shell script file with start on
          invocation. This is named by default aftr-script and located in
          $src_path. The AFTRSCRIPT environment variable and the -s
          argument give an alternate path. This file could be even empty,
          but must exist.

          The aftr daemon will eventually execute the shell script file
          with the stop argument before it exits.

          The conf directory provides examples (including the
          configuration files used in our testbeds). aftr-script.freebsd
          variant is for a FreeBSD based AFTR.

   -u socket-name
          As an alternative to TCP over IPv4 and IPv6 with localhost
          control channels, the aftr process can accept PF_UNIX stream
          socket control channel on the socket-name.

3.3. Configuration File

   Included inline aftr-conf (5)

Name

   aftr.conf — configuration file for aftr

Synopsis

   aftr.conf

DESCRIPTION

   The aftr daemon requires a configuration file. By default it is named
   aftr.conf, and is located in $src_path. The AFTRCONFIG environment
   variable and the -c argument give an alternate path. Sample
   configuration files are provided in $src_path/conf/aftr.conf (OS
   independent).

   The configuration file consists of a set of one-line configuration
   commands. Commands are not case sensitive. Any line beginning with '#'
   or whitespace is ignored as a comment.

   Configuration and interactive commands belong to sections:
     * section zero is for global parameters which must be defined before
       anything else when they are not kept to their default values, for
       instance defmtu.
     * section one is for required parameters, for instance acl6.
     * section two is for reloadable parameters, for instance nat.
     * interactive only commands are in the section three.

   Only the section one commands are required; reasonable defaults are
   provided for all other configuration parameters. See conf/aftr.conf for
   an example of a minimal configuration file.

   default tunnel auto on|off
          Enables or disables on-the-fly tunnel creation. Default is on.

   default tunnel mss on|off
          This enables or disables TCP MSS patching on packets going from

          If any tunnels are explicitly configured, this must be specified
          before them. Default is off.

   default tunnel mtu mtu
          Specifies mtu as the default IPv6 MTU of tunnels. Can be
          overridden by per-tunnel configuration.

   default tunnel toobig on|off|strict
          This specifies the policy for packets from the Internet which
          are too big (i.e., they don't fit in one IPv6 encapsulating
          packet) and are marked as "don't fragment". 'On' means a ICMPv4
          packet too big error is returned to the source, 'off' the packet
          just go through, and 'strict' the packet is dropped with a
          ICMPv4 error. Default is on (i.e., the packet is encapsulated
          into some IPv6 fragments and a ICMP error is returned for path
          MTU determination).

   default tunnel fragment ipv6|ipv4 maxcount maxcount
          Specifies the maximum number of reassembly queue entries per
          tunnel. Compile time options are FRAGTN[46]_MAXCNT, default

          TCP_MAXNATCNT 2000, UDP_MAXNATCNT 200, ICMP_MAXNATCNT 50.
          Minimum is 0 (included), maximum is 65535.

   default tunnel nat tcp|udp|icmp rate limit
          Specifies the maximum rate of dynamic NAT creation per second.
          Compile time options are [TCP|UDP|ICMP]_MAXTNATRT, default
          values are TCP_MAXNATRT 50, UDP_MAXNATRT 20, ICMP_MAXNATRT 5.
          Minimum is 0 (included), maximum 255.

   delete privateIPv4_address
          This removes the IPv4 private prefix with the IPv4 address. It
          is an error to have no private prefixes.

   defmss on|off
          Alias of default tunnel mss on|off.

   defmtu mtu
          Alias of default tunnel mtu mtu.

   deftoobig on|off|strict

          round (i.e., the size of a slice of work). Compile time option
          is QUANTUM, default value is 20. Minimum is 2 (included),
          maximum is 255.

REQUIRED CONFIGURATION COMMANDS

   address endpoint IPv6_address
          IPv6_address is the AFTR endpoint address of the Softwire
          tunnels. If the DHCPv6 ds-lite option is used, this address must
          match the advertised address.

          It is a required command: it absolutely must be present in the
          aftr.conf file; the aftr daemon will not start without it.

   address icmp IPv4_address
          IPv4_address is a global IPv4 address used as the source for
          ICMP errors sent back to the Internet (i.e., the ICMPv4 errors
          will look like returned from an intermediate router that has
          this address). It is a required command.

   pool IPv4_address [tcp|udp|echo min-max]
          This specifies a global IPv4 address that will be used as the
          source address of NAT'ed packets sent to the Internet. Multiple
          global addresses can be specified, at least one is required.

          The optional part limits the port (or id) range used for the
          protocol with the global IPv4 address in dynamical bindings
          (i.e., not static or A+P bindings which can use the reserved
          ports outside the range).

   acl6 IPv6_prefix/prefix_length
          This adds an (accept) entry in the IPv6 ACL. Note for a regular
          IPv6 packet the ACL is checked only when no tunnel was found,
          and the default is "deny all", so at least one acl6 entry in the
          configuration file is required.

RELOADABLE CONFIGURATION COMMANDS

   tunnel IPv6_remote [IPv4_src]
          This specifies an IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel configuration. IPv6_remote
          is the remote (ds-lite client) IPv6 address of the tunnel.
          Either the tunnel is associated with a source address in a round
          robin way or it is associated to the specified IPv4_src.

   nat IPv6_remote tcp|udp IPv4_src port_src IPv4_new port_new
          This defines a static binding/NAT entry for the client behind
          the tunnel at IPv6_remote. *_src are the source IPv4 address and
          port at the tunnel side of the NAT, *_new are the source IPv4
          address and port at the Internet side of the NAT. IPv4_new
          should be a reserved source NAT address, port_new must not be
          inside a dynamic port range.

   prr IPv6_remote tcp|udp IPv4 port
          This defines a Port-Range Router/A+P null NAT entry for the
          client behind the tunnel at IPv6_remote. IPv4 and port are the
          source IPv4 address and port at the tunnel side of the NAT. They
          stay unchanged both ways: this entry is used to check
          authorization and perform port routing.

   nonat IPv6_remote IPv4/prefix_length
          This defines a No-NAT tunnel for the client behind the tunnel at
          IPv6_remote and the prefix IPv4/prefix_length. No translation is
          performed for matching packets.

   mss IPv6_remote on|off
          This enables or disables TCP MSS patching on packets going from
          and to the tunnel of IPv6_remote. Default is off.

   mtu IPv6_remote mtu
          This changes the IPv6 MTU of the tunnel of IPv6_remote to mtu.

   toobig IPv6_remote on|off|strict
          Per-tunnel configuration of the too big policy.

   debug set [level]
          Specifies the debug level. Default is 0. If set to non 0,
          verbose log messages will be dumped to stderr. The higher the
          level is, the noiser the logs are. At present, the meaningful
          levels are 1 (log tunnel creation), 3 (log packet reads and
          writes), and 10 (function entry tracing). If the level is
          omitted, it is set to 1.

   try tunnel IPv6_remote [IPv4_src]
          Create when it doesn't already exist an IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel,
          returns in all cases the description of the tunnel entry. This
          command should be used by tools managing temporary port
          forwarding. IPv6_remote must be acceptable for IPv6 ACLs.

   try nat IPv6_remote tcp|udp IPv4_src port_src IPv4_new port_new
          Create when it doesn't already exist a static binding/NAT entry.
          This command should be used by tools managing temporary port
          forwarding. The tunnel must exist.

3.4. Interactive Commands

   Included inline aftr-commands (5)

Name

   aftr.command — interactive commands for aftr

Synopsis

   aftr.commands

DESCRIPTION

   The aftr daemon runs in the background. After it starts, it can be
   controlled interactively from a control channel (aka. a session).

   All of the reloadable configuration commands can be allowed to run from
   the command line, to add or change configuration. In addition, the
   following commands can be run interactively.

INTERACTIVE COMMANDS

   abort
          Call abort(3) to create a core file. Please try to use it only
          on forked processes.

   echo xxx
          Echo the command. This can be used for an external tool to
          synchronize with the AFTR daemon.

   fork
          Fork the aftr process. In the parent the current session is
          closed (so after this command you'll talk only to the child) and
          other activities, including packet forwarding, are continued. In
          the child all file descriptors at the exception of the current
          session are closed.

          This command should be used before to execution an expensive and
          atomic operation like list commands or some debug commands, and
          of course the abort command.

   help [all]
          List available or all commands.

   kill
          Orderly kill the aftr process.

   load file
          Redirect the input of the current session from the content of
          the file. This is done in an atomic way (i.e., there is no other
          activity during the operation) but exists if a command fails.

   quit
          Obsolete, use session close (for closing the current session) or
          kill (for killing the process).

   reboot
          Reboot the whole process.

   reload
          Reload the section two part of the config file. This is sliced
          with the packet forwarding, but not with session reading (so you
          can't execute a command until reload is finished).

          The reload process uses a generation system: static NAT, PRR/A+P
          and no-NAT entries in the reloaded file are put in the next
          generation. If the reload succeeds, global entries in older
          generations are garbaged collected, if it fails new generation
          entries are backtracked to the previous generation. Garbage
          collection and backtracking are sliced with the packet
          forwarding, another reload command is forbidden until they
          finish so a reload flushes the input buffer of the current
          session.

   show dropped|stat
          Aliases of debug dropped and debug stat, display dropped packet
          and general statistics.

DEBUG COMMANDS

   noop
          Returns LOG: alive.

   debug check [nat|nonat|pool|session|tunnel]
          Performs some sanity checks on structures. Reserved to expert
          usage on a forked process (or better core file debugged with
          gdb). Note it uses recusive deep structure walking so can eat a
          lot of stack.

   debug disable [clear]
          Disable per-tunnel debug counters. Optionally clear them.

   debug dropped
          This displays the dropped packet statistics with reasons.

   debug enable addr
          Enable per-tunnel debug counters for the tunnel with addr remote
          IPv6 address. Note the counters can be incremented only when the
          involved tunnel is known, for instance, only after reassembly.

   debug fragment IPv6|in|out
          This displays the list of IPv4 or IPv6 fragments awaiting
          reassembly.

   debug fragment addr
          This displays information about a single fragment or fragment
          chain. add> is the memory address of the fragment structure
          (from a previous debug fragment command).

   debug hash
          This displays some statistics about the various hash tables
          (fragment, nat, and tunnel).

   debug nat
          This displays some information about the nat hash table and
          entry table.

   debug nat addr
          This displays detailed information about a single nat binding.
          addr is the memory address of the nat structure (from a previous
          debug nat command).

   debug nonat
          This displays the list of no-nat tunnel entries.

   debug pool
          This displays the global IPv4 addresses that will be used for
          NAT mapping.

   debug session
          This displays the control channel session types with the number
          of active sessions.

   debug stat
          This displays some general statistics about packets in and out.
          If per-tunnel debug counters are enable, displays them.

   debug tunnel
          This displays some information about the tunnel table.

   debug tunnel IPv6_remote
          This displays some information about a single tunnel.

DELETE COMMANDS

   delete acl6 IPv6_address
          This removes the IPv6 ACL entry with the IPv6 address.

   delete nat IPv6_remote tcp|udp IPv4 port
          This removes a static or dynamic NAT binding.

   delete nonat IPv6_remote
          This removes a no-nat tunnel entry.

   delete private IPv4_address
          Look at zone zero configuration commands.

   delete prr IPv6_remote tcp|udp IPv4 port
          This removes a Port-Range Router/A+P null NAT binding.

   delete tunnel IPv6_remote
          This removes a tunnel and all NAT bindings associated with it.

LIST COMMANDS

   list acl6
          List IPv6 ACLs.

   list default
          List all the default values which can be set by a
          'default'/'global' command.

   list nat [conf|static|prr|dynamic|all|global]
          List the NAT entries in the configuration file format. Default
          is to list only the configured ('conf') NAT entries. 'global'
          lists the the configured global (i.e., not by a session) active
          (i.e., not to be garbaged collected after a reload) NAT entries.

   list nonat
          List all the No-NAT tunnel entries in the configuration file
          format.

   list pool
          List the NATted source addresses with current port ranges in the
          configuration file format.

   list session [name|generation]
          List the static NAT, PRR/A+P and no-NAT entries created by the
          current session or the session with name or with generation
          (note these entries will be flushed when the session will be
          closed so this command can be used to get them in order to
          include them in the config).

   list tunnel
          List the tunnel entries in the configuration file format,
          including specific MTU (if different from the default MTU).

SESSION COMMANDS

   These commands deal directly with sessions (aka. control channels).

   session close [name|generation]
          Close the current or designed session. Delete all the static
          NAT, PRR/A+P and no-NAT entries created by the current session
          and which were not promoted to global/permanent entries by a
          reload.

   session config on|off
          Enable/disable the section two configuration commands. By
          default configuration commands must go to the config file.

   session log on|off
          Log errors or don't for the current session. Default is on.

   session name [name]
          Display or set the name of the current session. The stdio
          initial session is statically named 'tty'.

   session notify on|off
          Log tunnel removal or don't to the current session. Default is
          off.

Chapter 4. Managing AFTR

4.1. Syslog

   Errors, debug messages, traces, etc, are logged through syslog with
   aftr as the program name.

   The default facility is LOG_LOCAL5 (can be changed at compile time by
   setting AFTRFACILITY), the default openlog() option is LOG_NDELAY (can
   be changed at compile time by setting AFTRLOGOPTION, for instance to
   add LOG_PID). Levels are:
     * critical errors (i.e., the process must be rebooted) to LOG_CRIT
     * error conditions (i.e., bad packets, not critical memory allocation
       failures, bad commands, etc) to LOG_ERR
     * warnings to LOG_WARNING
     * informational messages (including I/O logs) to LOG_INFO
     * debug messages (cf. debug set xxx) to LOG_DEBUG
     * trace messages (see next section) to LOG_NOTICE

4.1.1. Trace Logging

   Trace messages are:
     * tunnel add|del client_IPv6
     * seconds bucket client_IPv6 natted_IPv4 tcp|udp [#port]+

   If TRACE_NAT was defined at compile time (default is undefined):

   if NOPRIVACY is kept undefined:
     * seconds nat add|del client_IPv6 tcp|udp natted_IPv4 port

   if NOPRIVACY is defined:
     * seconds nat add|del client_IPv6 tcp|udp client_IPv4 client_port
       natted_IPv4 natted_port destination_IPv4 destination_port

4.2. Security

   The aftr process needs the root privilege to open the tunnel
   interface/device. The TCP over IPv4/IPv6 control channels are bound to
   localhost so are limited to the local node. There are many tools which
   provide a secure connection forwarding, for instance ssh -L. The
   PF_UNIX control channel relies on standard file system permissions (cf.
   umask), it should be used for finer control than node access.

   The source address of encapsulated IPv4 in IPv6 packets must be a
   private address. The list of IPv4 private prefixes is initialized to
   RFC 1918 prefixes and the unpublished I-D, it is manageable by zone
   zero commands. IPv6 ACLs filter incoming IPv6 packets.

   The try commands are protected against not authorized tunnel creation,
   i.e., both IPv6 and IPv4 ACLs are applied to try command arguments.

4.3. Debug primer

   Unlimit the core dump size if you'd like to get core file on crashes or
   with the abort command. On Linux twist the core naming to something
   better than core (cf. core(5)). Please keep the binary associated to
   core files. As the fork command is fun but eats memory put enough
   memory in the aftr box...

   When the aftr process is not (yet) crashed but seems no longer to
   forward packets:
     * go to an open session (try to keep on in case the alternative
       fails) or if none open a new one
     * check if it is responsive using the noop (answer LOG: alive), if
       not try to get a core file (attach in gdb and use gcore), kill it
       (another way to get a core file with ^\ / kill) and relaunch it
     * if not in a hurry try to understand the issue with show stat and
       show dropped
     * open a second session, send fork to get a child process where you
       can use extensive debug, including gdb, on it. If you don't know or
       you can't understand, abort the child process to get a core file.
     * update the config file if needed, reboot the parent/main process
       (it will lose all the state and restart from the beginning)

   Summary for the busy operator:
     * noop -> nothing: go to the shell to kill and relaunch it
     * noop -> expected message: open another session, send fork, wait for
       the child pid message, send abort on this new session. On the
       previous session (where you sent noop), send reboot

Chapter 5. XML Interface

   The "XML interface" is a way for service providers to programmatically
   manage static port mappings on behalf of their customers.

   For instance, the service provider might have a web portal, tied into
   the provisioning system, through which a customer could request a small
   number of static port mappings. The provisioning system would send an
   XML-encoded request to the AFTR that is serving that customer, and the
   AFTR would send back an XML-encoded reply.

   The xml subdirectory contains a specification for the remote
   configuration protocol, together with a server that runs on the AFTR
   box, and an example client that runs on the provisioning system.

5.1. Transport

   The server and client communicate over either HTTP or a plain TCP
   socket. By default, they use HTTP. To change to TCP socket, you must
   edit both xmlconf.py and xmlclient.py, commenting out the line
   TRANSPORT = 'http', and uncommenting the line TRANSPORT = 'socket'.

5.2. Remote Configuration Daemon

   Included inline xmlconf (8)

Name

   xmlconf.py — remote configuration daemon for aftr

Synopsis

   xmlconf.py [-l listening-addr] [-p listening-port] [-r remote-addr] [-c
   config-file] [-v]

OPTIONS

   -l listening-addr
          This specifies a local address on which to listen. If not
          specified, it listens on all local addresses.

   -p listening-port
          This specifies a local port on which to listen. Defaults to port
          4148 for HTTP transport, or port 4146 for socket transport.

   -r remote-addr
          This specifies a single address that the server will listen to.
          The server should only get configuration requests from the
          provisioning system, at a known address, so this is a simple
          form of access control. Use of this option is not required, but
          it is recommended.

   -c config-file
          This specifies the name and location of the aftr configuration
          file. For obvious reasons, this option MUST specify the same
          file that is used to configure the running aftr daemon. Default
          is ./aftr.conf.

   -v
          This enables run-time debugging messages. It should not be used
          in production, but it can help to debug or monitor interactions
          between xmlconf.py and the aftr daemon.

5.3. Remote Configuration Client

   Included inline xmlclient (8)

Name

   xmlclient.py — remote configuration client for aftr

Synopsis

   xmlclient.py aftr-addr [command]

OPTIONS

   aftr-addr
          This is the address (IPv4 or IPv6) the the target AFTR.

COMMANDS

   create user-ipv6 protocol src-ipv4 src-port nat-ipv4 nat-port
          This requests the aftr to create a port mapping.

   create user-ipv6 nat-ipv4
          This requests the aftr to create a tunnel entry, using nat-ipv4
          as the natted IPv4 address for all future port mappings on this
          tunnel (dynamic as well as static).

   delete user-ipv6 protocol src-ipv4 src-port nat-ipv4 nat-port

   delete user-ipv6 protocol src-ipv4 src-port

   delete protocol nat-ipv4 nat-port
          These three forms of the delete command all request the aftr to
          delete a port mapping. The mapping can be fully specified (first
          form), but a mapping can also be uniquely identifed by either
          internal parameters (second form) or external parameters (third
          form).

   delete user-ipv6
          This requests the aftr to delete all port mappings (dynamic as
          well as static) and other state associated with the given tunnel
          address. This is often done prior to moving the customer to a
          new natted IPv4 address.

   flush
          This requests the aftr to remove all static port mappings and
          configured tunnel entries. Note that this is a very drastic
          action, and should only be undertaken if (for example) the aftr
          configuration is seriously out of sync with the provisioning
          system.

   get user-ipv6
          This requests the aftr to report all static port mappings
          associated with the given tunnel address.

   get
          This requests the aftr to report all static port mappings, and
          all configured tunnels without static port mappings.

SCRIPTING

   If no commands are given on the command line, xmlclient.py will read
   commands from stdin. This allows the provisioning system to accumulate
   changes for a given AFTR, and send them all at once.

   In general, it is probably easier for the provisioning system to send
   requests immediately, and get replies immediately. However, some
   operators may prefer to batch up requests, and this method sends
   multiple requests over an open connection, without having to establish
   a connection for each request.

   Example:
   xmlclient.py 2001::500 <script

   where script contains:
   create 2001::525a:8c5a:30d4:e36e tcp 192.168.0.88 6265 198.18.200.174
   5005
   create 2001::835c:1eff:8d66:22fc tcp 192.168.1.138 3877 198.18.200.121
   5572
   create 2001::e3:9a2f:8abf:40de:2d87 udp 192.168.0.92 7356
   198.18.200.149 5547

Chapter 6. Advanced Topics

6.1. No-Nat/Pass-Through

   In a world where IPv4 address sharing is the norm, one might imagine
   that some customers would be willing to pay a little more for a full,
   non-shared global IPv4 prefix or address (i.e., a /32 prefix).

   In this case, the customer would perform the NAT function in his own
   CPE, but he would still have to tunnel IPv4 traffic through the
   provider's IPv6-only network to the AFTR.

   As yet, there is no defined signalling for the client to request a
   non-shared IPv4 prefix, or for the server to establish a non-natted
   tunnel. All configuration must be done manually, on both the B4 and the
   AFTR.
     * On the B4, the tunnel will still have to be set up, and all IPv4
       traffic will have to be routed to the tunnel, but only after the
       local NAT function is performed.
     * On the AFTR, a nonat command will have to be entered in aftr.conf,
       and a route to the customer's IPv4 prefix will have to be created
       in aftr-script.

6.2. A+P/Port-Range Routing

   A+P is a different approach to IPv4 address sharing, described in
   draft-ymbk-aplusp-05.txt. In this scenario, each customer is
   provisioned with a global IPv4 address, but only a restricted range of
   ports he can use within that address.

   Similar to the no-nat case above, the customer would perform the NAT
   function within his own CPE (ensuring that all port mappings are within
   the provisioned range), but he would still have to tunnel IPv4 traffic
   through the provider's IPv6-only network to the AFTR.

   As yet, there is no defined signalling for the client to request an A+P
   assignment, or for the server to establish a non-natted tunnel. All
   configuration must be done manually, on both the B4 and the AFTR.
     * On the B4, the tunnel will still have to be set up, and all IPv4
       traffic will have to be routed to the tunnel, but only after the
       local NAT function is performed.
     * On the AFTR, a prr command will have to be entered in aftr.conf,
       and a route to the customer's IPv4 address will have to be created
       in aftr-script.

6.3. Sharing a Single Address

   In production use, an AFTR will have a pool of global IPv4 addresses
   that are used exclusively for natted port mappings.

   However, for testing or demonstration purposes, you may want to deploy
   AFTR on a box with only one IPv4 address:
     * This address is used for standard services of the box.
     * This address is used by application proxies etc., in particular the
       DNS caching server.
     * This address is used to NAT traffic, i.e., for the AFTR function.

   The address can be dynamic (provisioned by DHCP), but must not change
   during an AFTR process run.

   The AFTR box is configured to use the eth0 interface on the WAN side,
   the eth1 on the LAN side. The AFTR process itself is configured as
   usual, but it uses a pseudo-public address (i.e., an address which is
   not recognized as private but in fact is a reserved public address, the
   first to avoid confusion, the second to avoid a collision with a real
   public address).

   Netfilter/iptables is used to map the pseudo-public address to the real
   public address. Port forwarding is a bit more complex, as the port
   range used for port forwarding must be port-forwarded (destination
   natted in netfilter/iptables terms) as-is (i.e., not changing ports) to
   the pseudo-public address. Of course there is nothing which can be done
   for no-NATs or for A+P/PRR as the first router/NAT of the Internet
   connection has no reason to support it.

   Note that this creates a double-NAT situation within the AFTR box:
   customer traffic is natted once in the AFTR itself, to the
   pseudo-public address, then a second time in netfilter, to the real
   public address. This is obviously not ideal from a performance
   perspective, but this scenario is only for testing and demonstration
   purposes.

   For the AFTR box itself configuration should be:
     * Use the standard setup for eth0 (i.e., plain DHCP).
     * Use the standard setup for the AFTR function, only the script needs
       to be special.
     * IPv4 forwarding must be enabled.
     * Don't forget to flush iptables and ip6tables.

   Use or adapt the example aftr.conf and aftr-script files from the
   conf/shareone directory. (They use 198.18.200.111 as the pseudo-public
   address and 5000-59999 TCP and UDP port ranges for dynamic NAT
   bindings.)

   If the kernel supports it (see iptables SNAT section) it can be useful
   to add --random to the SNAT rule in order to get back port
   randomization.

6.3.1. For netfilter/iptables Wizards

     * $PUBLIC is the shared real public address, it is taken from the
       eth0 configuration.
     * The flush in stop and at the beginning of start is for cleaning NAT
       rules.
     * The SNAT rule just creates a new conntrack NAT entry for the first
       packet of a flow to the Internet coming from the AFTR. It adds no
       constraint on the protocol or the natted source port (but the AFTR
       has itself such constraints, protocols are tcp/udp/icmp-echo and
       the source port will be in the range declared in the pool so the
       natted port should be in one of the ranges decribed in iptables
       SNAT section).
     * The first DNAT rule remaps traffic to a matching port to the pseudo
       public address without changing the destination port. It is used
       for port forwarding.
     * Destination ports are protocol specific so the rules have to be
       duplicated from TCP to UDP.
     * Locally generated traffic doesn't go through PREROUTING, so the
       rules have to be duplicated from PREROUTING to OUTPUT.

   Don't forget that with conntrack a NAT entry matches the both ways, so
   what matters is the processing of the first packet of a flow. Further
   packets are recognized by conntrack to belong to the same flow,
   including in the "reverse" way, and the NAT rule is applied (the
   symmetrical rule for reverse way packets). And conntrack is also used
   to recognize local traffic.
